I've started my own game programming studio called Beyond Realms. Our first project is a fighting game called PsykoShowdown. It has just started so stay tuned for more info! We also have our last project of our first year at EPITECH, my_rpg. This one is "finished" but we keep working on it to be as proud of it as we can be.
